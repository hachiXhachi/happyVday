Hellooooo, hahaha Happy Valentines day, I just want to seize this moment to tell you that i have a crush on you hahahahaha I never really thought na aabot ako sa ganito hahahahaha kasi i really dont expect na magiging close tayo, way back on our second year i didnt expect na magkakausap tayo and now here i am telling you that i like you, it starts nung march last year since naging conscious ako sayo hahahaha, wala naman kasi talaga akong pake sa mga tao non and hindi ko kasi inexpect na ichachat moko non hahahha kundi ako nagkakamali umaga ata yon sabi mo kamuka ko ung sinend mong picture na hahahahahahaha at first akala ko yun na yon dina ulit tayo maguusap and then dumating ung maraming circumstances na naging reason para magusap ulit tayo like nung sa research namin (thank you sa pagfillup btw) and then ung akala ko inunfriend moko yun pala nagdeact ka sa fb hahahahahahaha, I really appreciate you for giving me your time on those days kasi that time i am really at my lowest, also at that time i started to think of you as a close friend, and then suddenly bigla moko inunfollow sa ig non ðŸ˜­ huhuhuhu joke hahahaha, i think that was the turning point na magkacrush ako sayo kasi hahahahaha 1-week akong nagiisip non bakit moko inunfollow hahahahaha as in 1-week ikaw lang iniisip ko pero dont worry hindi naman ako nagalit non hahahahahaha medyo napa overthink lang talaga ako ng sobra sobra that time kasi ang akala ko may nagawa akong mali sayo hahahahahahahahahaha buti nalang cinlarify mo sakin yon hahahahahaha, then after mga ilang weeks non chinat mo ulit ako hahahaha nagpapatulong ka sakin non eh hahahahaha I am so happy at that time and that was the moment i realize i have a feelings for you, i remember those midnight talking we have hahahahahaha, ung first time natin mag codm hahaha sorry kinakabahan ako nung time na yon hahahaha di ako makatutok ng tama gulat kasi ako non nagcaclaim lang ako ng mga freebies tas biglang nag pop-up ign mo hahahaha, pero ung mic ko talaga non hindi gumagana kasi low spec lang cp ko and im so happy that i got to know more about you, I found out that we have some similarities and share a lot of difficulties in life, after those days, I start to think about you everyday, in morning you are one i already think of, I always hope that its you everytime i receive a notification, I always think of you everytime i hear a love song and it gives me butterfly everytime we interact with each other, at first i try to deny my feelings for you kasi ayoko na talagang masaktan pa ulit, ayoko na umasa, and natakot akong paglaruin ulit ung feelings ko gaya ng mga nangyari dati hahahahahaha pero here i am right now confessing to you because after all the chats we have, I got to know you better and I believe you will respect my feelings even if we dont feel the same way, after getting to know you, I dont mind getting rejected by you, of course I dont want that to happen but I cannot do anything about your feelings and I know you have a lot going on in your life and I just wanted you to know that theres a person out here that care for you, you dont have to reply to my confession, i just wanted you to be aware of my feelings, Its up to you whether you reject me right now or not and Im fine whatever you choose, you can take your time, the only thing I ask is, please tell me if you already have someone you like so I can backout my feelings, Dont worry I'll always respect your feelings. 
As of now, i have nothing, and I am nothing, the only thing i can offer to you are vague things like my future, my loyalty, and myself, but if its fine for you, when i became the best version of myself, I'll pursue you, but thats if its okay to you, I know you already experience a lot of hardship in life and I dont want to be one of those person who do bad things to you, thats why I will not force my feelings to you and dont worry even if you reject me I'll still treat you the same as before, nothing will change on the way i interact to you, we already have a lot of problems so I dont want to add to yours. 
I really have a lot of things i wanted to tell you but I cant really summarize all of it, I cant pack up all of my feelings in just minimal words, Actually nakakailang edit nadin ako sa letter na to hahahaha, lastly, whatever response you have to my confession, whether you ignore this message, reject me or stop talking to me, Its fine by me, I can respect your feelings all I wanted is for you to realize my feelings thats why I hope youre not pressurise by this message. 
thank you for reading and i hope you have a good day, once again, Happy Valentines Day! <br>
